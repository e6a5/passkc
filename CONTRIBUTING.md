## Release Process

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions when tags are pushed:

1. **Version tagging**: We use semantic versioning (v1.2.3)
2. **Automated builds**: Cross-platform binaries are built automatically
3. **GitHub Releases**: Release notes are generated from tag annotations

Maintainers handle releases, but contributors can suggest when a release might be appropriate.

## Getting Help

- **Questions**: Open a discussion or issue
- **Chat**: Mention @e6a5 in issues or PRs
