	Use:   "passkc",
	Short: "A Unix-style password manager using macOS Keychain",
	Long: `passkc is a command-line tool for managing credentials in macOS Keychain.
It follows Unix philosophy by:
- Doing one thing well: managing credentials
- Working with text streams
- Being composable with other tools
- Using plain text interfaces
- Avoiding captive user interfaces

Examples:
  # Get credentials and pipe to clipboard
  passkc get domain.com | pbcopy

  # List credentials and filter
  passkc show | grep "google"

  # Set credentials from file
  passkc set -f credentials.txt

  # Output in JSON format
  passkc show -o json | jq '.[] | select(.domain == "google.com")'`,
	// Uncomment the following line if your bare application
	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.

	err := rootCmd.Execute()
	if err != nil {
