Store and retrieve passwords securely using the macOS Keychain.

Common usage:
  passkc set github.com myusername     # Save a password
  passkc get github.com                # Retrieve a password
  passkc show                          # List all saved passwords
  passkc remove github.com             # Delete a password

Advanced usage:
  passkc get github.com -q | pbcopy    # Copy password to clipboard
  passkc show | grep google            # Search for specific sites`,
	// Uncomment the following line if your bare application
	// has an action associated with it:
